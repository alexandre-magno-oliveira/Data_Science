<h3> DATA ANALYSTS X DATA SCIENTISTS </h3>

  <h4>DATA ANALYSTS</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> EDA is an essential skill for data analysts. It
  helps with inspecting data to discover patterns, test hypotheses, and assure
  assumptions.</li>
  <li><b>Relational Database:</b> Knowledge of at least one of the relational database tools,
  such as MySQL or Postgre, is mandatory. SQL is a must for working on relational
  databases.</li>
  <li><b>Visualization and BI Tools:</b> A picture speaks more than words. Visuals have
  more of an impact on humans and visuals are a clear and easy option for
  representing the insights. Visualization and BI tools such as Tableau, QlikView,
  MS Power BI, and IBM Cognos can help analysts visualize and prepare reports.</li>
  <li><b>Spreadsheet: </b>Knowledge of MS Excel, WPS, Libra, or Google Sheets is
  mandatory for storing and managing data in tabular form.</li>
  <li><b>Storytelling and Presentation Skills:</b> The art of storytelling is another necessary
  skill. A data analyst should be an expert in connecting data facts to an idea or an
  incident and turning it into a story.</li>
</ul>
  <h4>DATA SCIENTISTS</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Mathematics and Statistics:</b> Most machine learning algorithms are based on
  mathematics and statistics. Knowledge of mathematics helps data scientists
  develop custom solutions.</li>
  <li><b>Databases:</b> Knowledge of SQL allows data scientists to interact with the database
  and collect the data for prediction and recommendation.</li>
  <li><b>Machine Learning:</b> Knowledge of supervised machine learning techniques such
  as regression analysis, classification techniques, and unsupervised machine
  learning techniques such as cluster analysis, outlier detection, and
  dimensionality reduction.</li>
  <li><b>Programming Skills:</b> Knowledge of programming helps data scientists automate
  their suggested solutions. Knowledge of Python and R is recommended.</li>
  <li><b>Storytelling and Presentation skills:</b> Communicating the results in the form of
  storytelling via PowerPoint presentations.</li>
  <li><b>Big Data Technology:</b> Knowledge of big data platforms such as Hadoop and
  Spark helps data scientists develop big data solutions for large-scale enterprises.</li>
  <li><b>Deep Learning Tools:</b> Deep learning tools such as Tensorflow and Keras are
  utilized in NLP and image analytics.</li>
</ul>
